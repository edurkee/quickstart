      <description>5:30am.
It&amp;rsquo;s funny how different the trees are here. The leaves are thick and waxy and if they were everywhere you&amp;rsquo;d be in the jungle. You don&amp;rsquo;t think about the trees being different.
Berk and I got a taxi from the airport last night and made it to the apartment around 8pm, which (amen and hallelujah) does exist. Gerry, the roommate I corresponded with online also exists, but I&amp;rsquo;m less sure he is real.</description>

      <description>Berk is getting me another coffee. It&amp;rsquo;s 3am Taipei time (12:04pm SF time) and trying to beat the jet-lag in advance is going poorly. First leg of the journey is complete: 4 and a half hours from CLE to SFO felt slow. Not ecstatic for the next 14 hours to TPE. Berk rates bidets highly and the polaris lounge is for posers and pundits, but not pirates.</description>
