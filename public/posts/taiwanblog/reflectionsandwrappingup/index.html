    <h1>Reflections and wrapping up</h1>

    

    <p>4:13AM from Boston.</p>
<p>I left Taiwan somewhere around 60 hours ago.</p>
<p>So it goes.
But I’m sad to leave.</p>
<p>Taiwan is an incredible place. The streets of Taipei are so alive, so
visceral and dynamic. You can walk in a lot of cities and be an observer.
Taipei is not one of them. It’s something about the movement of the cars
and scooters, the twisting of the lanes. Taipei takes you in and makes you
a part of all that movement. It’s so close to you. So tangible in ways
other cities are not.</p>
<p>The mountains and nature in Taiwan is unbelievable. You can go right from
black beaches to lush, jungle mountain trails, where the canopy line is
draped in ivy like a heavy blanket, and no level of description will do it
justice. It was unbearably hot, though.</p>
<p>I feel like I got to know many sides of Taiwan. Nearly every weekend was a
trip somewhere else, some new adventure. And on the weekdays, it was all
about exploring Taipei, having adventures in our own backyard. I think it
was the time limit that inspired this drive to see and do absolutely
everything in the city. It hit me in the last few weeks that I’ve never
explored Montreal like this—I know the Taipei MRT better after two months
than the Montreal Metro after two years. So thank you, Taiwan, for
reminding me to explore my own backyard.</p>
<p>I love the people I met in Taiwan. The locals are unimaginably welcoming.
One day I had to tell XiaoZheng, who runs the breakfast joint that I would
frequent and who is so warm-hearted and had been so kind to me, that
people in the US would, indeed, not treat him very kindly for not speaking
English. After all the kindness of the Taiwanese people, all the
accommodations they made for my shitty Mandarin, telling him that he was
right about that physically hurt. The Taiwanese are not like that. They
default to Friend.</p>
<p>Gosh, and my friends! Sophia mentioned that she didn’t know you could get
that close to a group of people in such a short time, and I think that’s a
great way to put it. It was like a friendship speed run. My last night in
Taipei, we sat around the basement of J Corner bar drinking mega-pitchers
and laughing like we had been friends for years. We stayed out until four
in the morning, chopping it up and having a ball. And how sad is that, now
that we’re all dispersing back out across the world? I’m not sure what you
do about splitting off from wonderful people. I guess it’s the case for
all friendships, and all relationships, really. You appreciate the people
while you have them. You chat with them and stay up late with them and
drink with them and love them as they are and appreciate the fact that you
got to be a little part of their life and that you had the pleasure of
having them as a part of yours. You can try to take parts of them with
you. Their jokes, their relaxed confidence, ferventness for life, or the
way they can speak with such genuineness that you know you don’t even have
to respond. The way Ahmad says “That’s OK.”, and puts his hand on your
shoulder, and you can tell he means it so truly and entirely. You can
appreciate the people for being a brief part of your life, and you can try
to stitch beautiful parts of them into yourself, but no matter what, it’s
always going to be sad to say goodbye to friends. You’re all amazing, and
if you’re reading this I love you!</p>
<p>I really liked who I was in Taiwan. I was so active. I felt like the
agency of my own life every time I made something happen. I was
creation-oriented. And I liked the way I was with other people, especially
toward the end. I was making space for myself in relationships, something
I felt like I had stopped doing. And I was putting effort into
friendships, another thing I realized I haven’t always been best at. These
things paid off, and made my time in Taiwan all the better. I plan on
taking this with me.</p>
<p>As I got towards the end of my time in Taiwan, I know blog posts slowed
down. I got so engulfed in doing everything, juicing every second in
Taiwan. And that’s OK, I’m glad I did. I’ve got a couple posts in the
drafts about amazing adventures, but I don’t know that I’ll ever publish
them. They’re more of the same: here’s a chaotic list in paragraph form of
ridiculous things I’ve been up to. And while it’s nice to have a catalogue
of those lists, they’re not that satisfying wrt. my feelings about my time
in Taiwan now. Contrary to my last post about details, I’m enjoying less
of the single notes, and instead appreciating the melody.</p>
<p>I feel immensely satisfied with my time in Taiwan. As sad as I am to
leave, I’m also in need of a rest. The two-month time limit meant we
didn’t squander a second in Taiwan to inactivity. I was almost always on
the go. Even though I didn’t do everything in Taiwan, Nick wisely pointed
out to me that you don’t need to do everything to have a good time. I
thought that was great, and damn did I have a good time. So it feels good
to rest. To sleep in, guilt-free. I’m looking forward to slow mornings and
a cup of coffee in my Taiwan-mug, and a million other things back in
Montreal.</p>
