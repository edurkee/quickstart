    <h1>Language Goals</h1>

    

    <p>Despite being less than a week in, I’ve recently had the realization that
I’ll never achieve perfection in this language. The absolute best I think
I might possibly achieve is functionality, mediocrity, even
proficiency—but not without a heavy accent and frequent mistakes.
White-guyness notwithstanding, nobody is ever going to mistake me for a
native Mandarin speaker.</p>
<p>I’m beginning to understand that the amount of time and effort required to
reach a near-native level is… insane. And despite having been slamming my
head against Mandarin textbooks for six or so years now, I’m still a long
ways away: near-native level is not even on the horizon, hell it’s not
even on the map.</p>
<p>I was recalling a linguistics/psych study today that suggested that
motivation was the determining factor in acquiring L2, even more important
than intelligence itself. I have no doubt that I could put in the work to
achieve near-perfection in Mandarin. I could spend the next 10 years in
Mandarin-speaking countries, marry a local, make Mandarin my entire life
and personality, and then, I think, I would have done it.</p>
<p>I just don’t think I want to.</p>
<p>As of right now, seeing what the journey to near-perfection in Mandarin
looks like has magically fixed my sunk-cost mentality towards acquiring
this language. I see how much more it would take and I am amply ready to
change course from my goals of perfection. I have had the motivation to
get to the level of proficiency that I am currently at, and I have the
motivation to get a good bit better while I am here in Taipei, but at
least right now, I don’t have the motivation to get a whole lot better
than that.</p>
<p>This is not a bad thing, and by no means does it imply I’m abandoning this
language. All it means is that right now, I’m reevaluating my language
learning goals, probably something I should have done quite a while ago.
It’s not a loss of motivation or willpower, it’s a reallocation.</p>
<p>Before, my primary language learning goal was to achieve fluency. Not a
very S.M.A.R.T. goal. This goal lacks a particular reason, and has no real
motivating factor. I don’t want to go into business, I don’t think I want
to permanently resettle to Asia, and I don’t think diplomatic ambassador
to China is on the table. It was simply the goal because it had always
been the goal.</p>
<p>Now, I’m reorienting my language goals around experience. I want to have
practical abilities in Mandarin because I want to try to understand a
fully different culture and way of life. To see what it’s like to live on
the opposite side of the world, to connect with people, and to walk a mile
in somebody else’s socks in about as different of a place as I could get.
Now, the language isn’t the goal, the language is the tool. The goal is
breadth and variety of experience, something I think is vital if I want to
live a fulfilling and empathetic life, be confident in my experience and
knowledge of the world, and in my understanding of how much I don’t and
will never know.</p>
<p>I’m excited about these new goals and about what experiences Mandarin will
open me up to.</p>
<p>And also: the new Indiana Jones movie is a masterpiece.</p>
