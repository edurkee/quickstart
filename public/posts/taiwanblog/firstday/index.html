    <h1>Good morning from Taipei</h1>

    

    <p>5:30am.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny how different the trees are here. The leaves are thick and waxy
and if they were everywhere you&rsquo;d be in the jungle. You don&rsquo;t think about
the trees being different.</p>
<p>Berk and I got a taxi from the airport last night and made it to the
apartment around 8pm, which (amen and hallelujah) does exist. Gerry, the
roommate I corresponded with online also exists, but I&rsquo;m less sure he is
real. His chinese name is &ldquo;Hydrolic Press&rdquo; and he&rsquo;s moving to Australia
next month to become a miner. I haven&rsquo;t met any other flatmates yet, so I
can not confirm or deny whether they exist.</p>
<p>The weather so far is thick and hot, even at night. Every day
this week has a high in the mid 30s and a low high 20s. Thankfully our
rooms are airconditioned, though the rest of the apartment is not. My room
is nice, it gets good light and looks out toward a billboard with two
taiwanese business men crossing their arms and looking militant, like
they&rsquo;re ready to sue on my behalf. I can&rsquo;t read it, but it feels like
they would get along with Misney.</p>
<p>We walked for a little last night before Berk made the hike to his hostel
(his lease here doesn&rsquo;t start until July 1). According to Gerry, the city
is safe like nowhere else he&rsquo;s ever been. Motorists will leave their keys in
their scooters and their scooters running in the street while they pop
into shops. I believe him, but I&rsquo;ve almost been smooshed by a scooter
MarioKart style twice already.</p>
<p>Today, I think I just plan to explore! Though maybe after another hour of
sleep&hellip;</p>
