Balsamic Tofu

      <description>It was a fantastic weekend, and a narrative entirely of our own spontaneous creation. A couple weeks ago, a science-diver friend mentioned that if I wanted to get certified as an open water diver, she had an instructor to recommend. Then suddenly it was Saturday, I was at a train station in Fulong, and a crazy-haired Swedish guy was waving to me and two friends from his beat up Toyota SUV.</description>

      <description>It was a very nomadic weekend.
Over the past couple weeks, my routine has started striking some level of consistency. I wake up, eat a 蛋餅（dànbǐng), which is a sort of egg-crepe, then homework, workout, class, dinner, vibes, etc. Besides my daily Chinese class, on Thursdays I do a classical painting class, and on Fridays I play the Guzheng. The consistency has been quite nice, and I feel a lot more comforatable in the city than at first.</description>

      <description>Have you seen The Bee Movie?
If you haven’t you can stop reading right here and go give it a watch.
If you’re a real fan, you might remember the opening lines:
“According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly.
…
The bee, of course, flies anyway.”
To my purely Western perception of the laws of aviation, this is how I feel about a lot of parts of Taiwan.</description>

      <description>Traveling is funny sometimes. In a lot of ways, it gives me a huge appreciation for just how big and diverse the world is. It can be awesome to marvel in the size of it all. On the opposite vein, the more I travel, the more I realize just how small and connected the world is. Connected through the internet, yes, but what I really mean is connected through networks of people.</description>

      <description>Yesterday was my last day in Taiwan before classes begin. The way I saw it, it could have been a day of rest, preparing for the weeks of class ahead, or a day of activity, taking advantage of one last day with no homework or looming classes.
The beach was three buses and a train away, about 90 minutes of transit. None of the other people Berk and I have met yet wanted to get up early or spend so long on public transit, so we headed out by ourselves.</description>

      <title>Language Goals</title>

      <description>Despite being less than a week in, I’ve recently had the realization that I’ll never achieve perfection in this language. The absolute best I think I might possibly achieve is functionality, mediocrity, even proficiency—but not without a heavy accent and frequent mistakes. White-guyness notwithstanding, nobody is ever going to mistake me for a native Mandarin speaker.
I’m beginning to understand that the amount of time and effort required to reach a near-native level is… insane.</description>

      <description>An action packed past few days have made it feel like I&amp;rsquo;ve been here a lot longer than I have. In a good way.
Thursday: spent the day touring and doing various activities with Gerry (水壓機). Snapped some photos, pet some geese, and borrowed some beer mugs from dadaocheng wharf.
Friday:On this day, my body began to realize I played a nasty joke on it by flipping my clock backwards. Still, I give Taipei Museum of Fine Arts 9/10 stars.</description>

      <title>Good morning from Taipei</title>

      <description>5:30am.
It&amp;rsquo;s funny how different the trees are here. The leaves are thick and waxy and if they were everywhere you&amp;rsquo;d be in the jungle. You don&amp;rsquo;t think about the trees being different.
Berk and I got a taxi from the airport last night and made it to the apartment around 8pm, which (amen and hallelujah) does exist. Gerry, the roommate I corresponded with online also exists, but I&amp;rsquo;m less sure he is real.</description>

      <title>pirate&#39;s log 1: en-route</title>

      <description>Berk is getting me another coffee. It&amp;rsquo;s 3am Taipei time (12:04pm SF time) and trying to beat the jet-lag in advance is going poorly. First leg of the journey is complete: 4 and a half hours from CLE to SFO felt slow. Not ecstatic for the next 14 hours to TPE. Berk rates bidets highly and the polaris lounge is for posers and pundits, but not pirates.</description>
