At least, there are two types of boredom.

---

<strong>Type I Boredom:</strong>

You are picking rosemary off of sprigs.
Filling out piles of paperwork.
Doing homework that is too easy for you.

You are tired of what it is you are doing.
You would very much rather be doing something else--<i>anything</i> else.

<strong>Type II Boredom:</strong>

You have nothing to do, and you're not exactly sure <i>what</i> to do. 
The experiental equivalent of when you're hungry, but there's nothing in the fridge that you want to 
eat.
So you sort of just... ~exist~


<strong>Discussion:</strong>

In my experience, Type I boredom usually comes about when I am doing a tedious task that I have to do, but don't really want to do. And it sucks the life out of ya. It's a hamster-wheel existence, and it should exist only when it's absolutely necessary (and it rarely is). Type I 
Boredom is basically harmless when it comes to most menial activities, and often it can be exchanged for flow by a trick of the mind. Type I boredom is really only 
dangerous when it's your whole existence. By this, I mean when an act requires enough brain power for you to be cognitively present, but not enough brain power for you 
to feel challenged or engaged [^1]. In these cases, Type I boredom is a passion-killer.

On the other hand, I think Type II boredom can be really valuable, and I seem to see less and less of it as I get older. Type II boredom rolls around when there's 
nothing in particular that needs to occupy your mind. Homework is done, groceries are bought, dinner is made, and so now what? What do you do when there's nothing you 
have to do? Now it's clear why Type II boredom is much more common as a kid: there's not a whole lot you absolutely <i>have</i> to do. So we play, or read books, or 
draw pictures, and it's lovely, all these creative pursuits. But as silly little adults, Type II boredom slowly loses its shares of the Boredom-Pie Chart to Type I 
activities, like grocery shopping or paying bills or folding laundry until there's absolutely no slice left at all of Type II boredom. And I think that's a horrible 
thing. Unless they're built into your life through work or discipline that none of us (save David Goggins) have, I think Type II boredom is a prerequisite for most 
creative or growth-oriented activities. After all, had I not been sufficiently void of things to do, I never would have made this site, and if I had plenty else to 
occupy my mind, I certainly wouldn't be differentiating type of boredom. If there is no time to ponder different realities, to wonder what we should be doing with our 
time, we will never do anything new with it! In this sense, maybe much of the value of Type II boredome comes from its function as a reflection mechanism.

How we channel our Type II Boredom says a lot, too. I'm trying my best to be conscious of when I, in a two minute gap of Type II boredom, reactively reach for my phone. 
I won't go into how I think consumerist media eats at our Type II boredom slice and proportioning ability--but it totally does. I think of how many more hobbies, 
skills, friends, and experiences I could have if I make full use of my Type II boredom from here out. 

And when we get old? We suddenly go from no type II boredom at all, to more than we (literally) know what to do with. And after so many years out of practice, I bet a 
lot of people forget how to be bored the right way. The good news is, the boredom-pie is infinite. So even as Type I Boredom activities take on a larger role 
in our lives, I think it's still possible to maintain a healthy and appropriate dose of Type II boredom. 

So, my New Year's Resolution (May 17, '23 - May 17 '24) is to incorporate more Type II Boredom into my life. Type II Boredom that will hopefully get me into 
some shenanagins and be the source of stories, stuff, ideas, and projects.

[^1] It would be cool to see a study done that tries to differentially induce a state of Type I boredom versus a Flow state to find the cognitive threshold.
