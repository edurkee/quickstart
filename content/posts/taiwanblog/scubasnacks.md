I once heard that the only thing cooler than getting a knighthood is 
turning one down. That seems pretty true.

While I'm bummed to have missed the generational event of the 
Barbenheimer premier this weekend, I 
know that when my grandchildren inevitably one day ask, "Grandpa, where 
were you when Barbenheimer premiered?", I'll say I was busy--SCUBA diving. 

Highlights to write about... it feels like you're in a video game idk make 
it a fun post.... AGENCY. 

It was the kind of weekend that reminds you you have agency over your own life. 

It was a fantastic weekend, and a narrative entirely of our own spontaneous creation. A couple weeks ago, a science-diver friend mentioned 
that if I wanted to get certified as an open water diver, she had an instructor to recommend. Then suddenly it was Saturday, I was at a
train station in Fulong, and a Swedish guy was waving to me and two friends from his beat up Toyota SUV. We squeezed in with our backpacks
(he was our instructor, not just any Swedish guy), and from behind a row of air tanks in the trunk a voice welcomed us in: "How you 
going, lads?"

And thus we drove to the dive shop.   

The dive shop was about the size of a shipping container, but glass walls on either side let you see how beautifully wedged it was 
between a waxy green mountain and the pacific ocean. 

Divers are funny people
