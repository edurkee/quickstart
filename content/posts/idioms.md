Chinese Chengyu
Ted Lasso and Bob Green
The difference between american idioms and chinese ones... the american 
ones are all puns and the chinese ones are all literal.

the philosophical foundations of being like a kid with headgear - talkin' 
funny. 
 - a creativity challenge
 - 
 
new daily creativity challenge. no adjectives. 

Here is a list of idioms that I'd like to incorporate into my everyday 
speech:

got mixed feelings.

 - You couldn't pick him out of a crowd of two

 - Do bears shit in the woods? (only funny if you use it in completely 
wrong ways)

 - "You beating yourself up is like Woody Allen playing the clarinet. I 
don't wanna hear it." ~ Ted Lasso

- Rougher than a pine-cone toilet seat. ~ Bob Green

- "It's like trying to seel bubblegum in a lockjaw ward. You just can't 
get much done." ~ Bob Green

- "We're like the kid that plays second French horn in the school band. We 
gotta play better!" ~ Bob Green

- 畫蛇添足 ~ to draw legs on a snake

- 拋磚引玉 ~ throwing a brick to attract jade (in a good way)
