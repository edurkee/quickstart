An action packed past few days have made it feel like I've been here a lot 
longer than I have. In a good way. 

Thursday: spent the day touring and doing various activities with Gerry 
(水壓機). Snapped some photos, pet some geese, and borrowed some beer mugs 
from dadaocheng wharf. 

Friday:On this day, my body began to realize I played a nasty joke on it 
by flipping my clock backwards. Still, I give Taipei Museum of Fine Arts 9/10 
stars. After the museum, Berk and I had fish and chips and a Guinness each 
at a place around 圓山 
(yuanshan) station. Wandered into the National Taiwan Tourism Expo and 
some woman selling tea kindly gave us a sample of tea and then after 
asking if we wanted to try another, jump-scared me with a meat-broth. 
Slept for many hours.

Saturday: Energy levels beginning to return to normal! Ventured to see 
some Dragon Boat races in the morning with Berk and Grace, who he met
in his hostel. Marvelous, but took less time than we expected. So I 
googled museums in the area, and although I had small expectations, the 
Taiwan Museum of Miniatures absolutely exceeded anything I could have 
imagined. Despite costing more than the Taiwan Museum of Fine Arts, I give 
this museum 10/10 stars.


Miscellaneous:

- Mandarin is hard but I'm pretty sure I know the grocery store checkout 
script now. Progress.

- No to stinky tofu.

- Public transit for the win

- Ran into a couple from OHIO on the MRT
