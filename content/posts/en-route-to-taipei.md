Berk is getting me another coffee. It's 3am Taipei time (12:04pm SF time) 
and trying to beat the jet-lag in advance is going poorly. First leg of 
the journey is complete: 4 and a half hours from CLE to SFO felt slow. Not 
ecstatic for the next 14 hours to TPE. Berk rates bidets highly and the 
polaris lounge is for posers and pundits, but not pirates.
