5:30am.

It's funny how different the trees are here. The leaves are thick and waxy 
and if they were everywhere you'd be in the jungle. You don't think about 
the trees being different.

Berk and I got a taxi from the airport last night and made it to the 
apartment around 8pm, which (amen and hallelujah) does exist. Gerry, the 
roommate I corresponded with online also exists, but I'm less sure he is 
real. His chinese name is "Hydrolic Press" and he's moving to Australia 
next month to become a miner. I haven't met any other flatmates yet, so I 
can not confirm or deny whether they exist. 

The weather so far is thick and hot, even at night. Every day 
this week has a high in the mid 30s and a low high 20s. Thankfully our 
rooms are airconditioned, though the rest of the apartment is not. My room 
is nice, it gets good light and looks out toward a billboard with two 
taiwanese business men crossing their arms and looking militant, like 
they're ready to sue on my behalf. I can't read it, but it feels like 
they would get along with Misney.  

We walked for a little last night before Berk made the hike to his hostel 
(his lease here doesn't start until July 1). According to Gerry, the city 
is safe like nowhere else he's ever been. Motorists will leave their keys in 
their scooters and their scooters running in the street while they pop 
into shops. I believe him, but I've almost been smooshed by a scooter 
MarioKart style twice already.  

Today, I think I just plan to explore! Though maybe after another hour of 
sleep...
